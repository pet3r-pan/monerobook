## Specific Instructions for Official Monero GUI

The following instructions show how to carry out the tasks described above through the Monero graphical user interface (GUI). If you are using a different wallet, you can skip this section.

### Setting up a wallet

The official Monero GUI can be downloaded through www.getmonero.org. Once you have unpackaged and loaded the application, you will be presented with a language selection screen:

If you don’t see your language above, please feel free to [submit a translation to help others](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/tree/master/translations)! Once you select a language, the GUI will ask whether you wish to generate a new seed, or restore an existing wallet.

The Testnet and Stagenet are for developers, so do not check either option. If this is your first Monero wallet, press “create new wallet.” The Monero software will generate a new seed for you, and show you the 25-word seed mnemonic. Be sure to write this down and store it in asafe place where nobody else will find it!

Next, you will have the option to start your own node, or connect to a remote node.

You can enter a wallet password, to keep your fund secure if somebody else accesses your computer. The wallet password is a local security feature, like a PIN screen unlock. It does not impact the way or how your Moneroj are stored on the blockchain, so restoring your wallet from the seed will bypass the local passphrase.

### Receiving Monero

The “Receive” tab of the Monero GUI contains both the text and QR-code forms of your receiving addresses. The “Create new address” button generates as more “subaddresses,” which will all direct to this same wallet (seed). You can indicate an “Amount to receive,” which will be encoded into the QR code.

### Sending Monero

To send Monero, you simply specify the amount that you wish to send and the recipient’s address. The Payment ID field can be left blank, unless your recipient specifies a Payment ID in advance. The Description field is stored locally, so you can leave notes for yourself.

### Transaction History

### Proof of Payment

Proof of payment verification is available through the GUI under “prove/check.” The below screenshot shows the transaction ID, address, and transaction key from the Maria & Kahn example above.

## Problems and Troubleshooting

*Problem: I transferred Moneroj to my wallet, but my balance is still 0*

**Available solutions**

**1**) Check if you copied the correct Monero Address (sometimes malware can try to edit the
copied Monero address);

**2**) Verify whether transaction actually arrived at your wallet / address by these steps:

    A. Go to the Settings page of the GUI and press on Show seed & keys. Subsequently,
    copy the private view key.
    
    B. Go to https://xmrchain.net/ blockexplorer
    
    C. Enter your transaction ID / hash.
    
    D. Now search the page for Decode outputs.
    
    E. Enter your private view key. In addition, enter your address in the second box.
    
    F. Press on decode outputs.
    
    G. If it shows "output true" it proves you correctly received your XMR
    
**3**)Verify if you are connected to the blockchain (using either remote nodes or local daemon;

If everything above checks out it's most likely a visibility bug, meaning that your Moneroj are in the correct place, but your wallet has not yet found them. The Monero GUI uses a local cache that can take a few seconds to refresh, especially on Windows. If this problem persists, try to reach our channels for support (see chapter V).
