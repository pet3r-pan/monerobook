# Chapter 2

# Getting Started
The last chapter focused on WHY to use Monero; in this chapter you will learn HOW to use Monero. You can master using Monero without needing to learn any of the complex cryptographic or network technical details, so that extra information is saved for later in the book. **Chapter 2 will cover all the practical skills you’ll need to get started receiving,
storing, and spending your Moneroj**.

**The first part of this chapter covers key concepts and terminology for Monero use, as general information that will apply to any wallet or software.** Toward the end of the chapter, you’ll find handy guides for carrying out these steps using the free official open-source Monero command line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) software.

## What is a Wallet?

Before you obtain some Moneroj, you must plan ahead for where you will receive and store your funds. You will need a “wallet” to help you store and spend your Moneroj. Just like physical wallets for your bills, there are lots of different types of Monero wallets, and you can always move some of your money from an old wallet to a new one.

Wallets take care of the complicated cryptographic processes for you, so you don’t need to know any fancy mathematics to use Monero. You will only need to manage a seed and your address(es). Other details like “public keys” and “private keys” are managed behind-the-scenes by your wallet, so they are not discussed until chapter VI.

Your Monero seed is a secret number that your wallet uses to locate and spend your Moneroj, though it is converted into a series of 12-25+ words for convenience. This secret is like a treasure map to your money on the blockchain, and anybody who learns your seed can use their wallet to access and spend your Moneroj. For this reason, you must be extremely careful when you generate and store your seed. Do not set up a wallet in a coffee shop, where other patrons or cameras may see your secret. It is dangerous to store your seed electronically (e.g. in a text file or email) since malicious software or services may run off with your Moneroj.

Your seed is used to generate your address(es), which you can share with others. Most wallets will show your address in two different formats - a written string of numbers/letters, and a visual QR code. These are redundant, and you can safely share either form.

If your wallet is physically damaged, you can simply import your seed into a new wallet, and pick up right where you left off! As long as you have a copy of your seed, you can always access your funds. However, if you lose your seed, there is no way to ever recover access to your Moneroj. You may be familiar with passwords, which can usually be reset by contacting an administrator. **Seeds are not like passwords** - nobody else knows your secret, and the network is unable to shift your Moneroj to a account if you lose the old one.

Most software will prompt you to write down the seed when you initialize a new wallet, however some apps do this in the background, and you must take the initiative to backup your wallet. Be sure to do this immediately, or else a damaged device will cause you to permanently lose your funds.

## Selecting the best wallets for your needs

There are various storage solutions, and they vary in terms of convenience, privacy, and security. Your individual needs will determine which type(s) of wallets are best for you. Many people use multiple storage solutions: often a convenient “hot wallet” that holds small amounts for day-to-day use, complemented by a more secure “cold wallet” for long-term savings or large amounts. The varying wallet types described below differ primarily in where the secrets are stored.

## Software and Mobile Wallets

Software wallets (on a desktop PC or mobile device) are convenient for storing and using Monero. Many Monero users have a handy “hot wallet” on their phones, to pay for small purchases. A good rule of thumb is to only walk around carrying as much cryptocurrency money as you would feel comfortable holding in regular cash. The secrets are stored on your device, so your Moneroj could be stolen if you catch a virus or keylogger.

## Hardware Wallets

Hardware wallets are special physical devices that generate your seed, store the secrets based on your seed and carry out transactions, while never revealing your secret information to the connected device. While hardware wallets are less convenient than software wallets, they are extremely secure! Because of how they store your seed, you can safely use a hardware wallet to send transactions from a device that you suspect or know is compromised with malicious software.

## Paper Wallets

Paper wallets provide an inexpensive way to stash Moneroj that you do not plan to move frequently; you simply print out a physical copy of your public and secret information for safe storage. Since the secrets from your Monero seed are saved only on paper, not digitally, you do not have to worry about viruses or data leaks. However, paper wallets are not convenient for
frequent use, since you must transfer the secrets to a digital device every time you wish to send Moneroj.

## Web Wallets

Web wallets refer to platforms running on third-party services that you control through their website. Web are extremely convenient, at the expense of security and privacy. The wallet is only as trusted as the third party, and there are extra security risks associated with accessing your Moneroj through a web browser. Some of the more secure web wallets are designed to keep the seed and secrets on your device as [MyMonero](https://mymonero.com). If a web wallet provider is going to hold your seed on their computers (and let you log in to access your funds) then you should be very suspicious.

## Cold Wallets

Cold wallets refer to any device that is generally kept offline and used only for storing your secrets. They could use any operating system, and you must be very deliberate with strong security (including a firewall, antivirus, and extreme caution regarding accessing only trusted websites/software). The seed is still on the computer, however you keep the device sequestered from the rest of the world, as much as possible.

## Monero Wallet Links

Regardless of which type(s) of wallet you choose, be careful to only download vetted software from through proper channels. Phishing schemes and scam wallets are numerous, so be sure to double-check that you are installing legitimate software! If you enter your seed into a malicious wallet, your Moneroj will be gone before realize your mistake.

This section contains links to several open-source wallets that are developed and trusted by the Monero community.

## Using Monero

This section explains what you need to know for sending and receiving Monero. All of the examples in this book use the following seed:

` MASTERING MONERO DEMO SEED: lamb hexagon aces acquire twang bluntly argue when unafraid awning academy nail threaten sailor palace selfish cadets click sickness juggled border thumbs remedy ridges border `

You can import this seed in yourself to practice generating addresses, checking transaction history, and verifying payments. You can use this seed to follow along with examples in the book, but do not send your Monero to it! Anybody else reading Mastering Monero will be able to spend it!

### Receiving Monero

To receive Monero, all you have to do is find your address through your wallet and share it with the person sending you Moneroj. Most wallets will show your address in two formats: an alphanumeric string that is easy to copy+paste, and a QR code that is handy for scanning with a camera. Here are examples of both formats, from the DEMO seed above:

<RECEIVING FIGURE DRAFT TO ADDRESS “4BKj...feW5”>

This address that you share is not stored on the blockchain (thanks to a Monero feature known as “stealth addresses” that are discussed in Chapter III and Chapter VI). Monero also allows you to generate multiple “subaddresses” from your single secret seed, so you can share many different addresses that all deposit to the same wallet.

Wallets may wait 10 - 20 minutes for “confirmation” before marking funds as received and safe to spend (you can learn why in Chapter IV). This is a common security practice, and wallets usually show the “unconfirmed” transaction during the waiting period. If your wallet is waiting for a 0.06 XMR payment to confirm, you may see something like this:

`
Balance: 0.075 XMR
Available balance: 0.015 XMR
`

There is no need for concern when this occurs! Within less than a half hour, the funds will confirm and transfer to your available balance.

### Sending Monero

To send Monero, you only need to input the recipient’s address and the amount that you wish to transfer. If you are sending Moneroj to a business, they may also ask you to include a “payment ID” to connect your payment to your order. If you are sending Moneroj to yourself or a friend, you can leave the payment ID field blank.

Your wallet will add small network fees to pay for sending your transaction. The fee associated with a given transaction varies depending on current network load and the location of your funds. Wallets will usually suggest an appropriate fee to send your transaction in a reasonable time.

### Proof of Payment

Given Monero’s anonymity, you might wonder how somebody can prove that a payment was sent. Besides optional payment IDs, Monero has a second feature to selectively reveal proof that you sent funds. A legitimate “transaction key” can only be generated by the true sender.

*Example*

Suppose your friends Khan and Maria each owe you 0.06552376 XMR for a meal that you split. You only receive 1 payment, with the information below:

* **Amount**: 0.06552376 XMR
* **Transaction ID**: 4b540773ddf9e819f0df47708f3d3c9f7f62933150b90edc89103d36d42ca4b7
* **Received to (your) sub-address**: 899Ao1NQtu4ezACgw1QKXK4QBf5s8a3WHHtAjFfPm3Nf71mAkREEgAuKzASXHt8E7vVJFKsQJuvApBfu21WY9WN97Put8M5

This is a real transaction received by the DEMO wallet on 20-Apr 2018. You can see *some* information through a [blockchain explorer](https://monerohash.com/explorer/search?value=4b540773ddf9e819f0df47708f3d3c9f7f62933150b90edc89103d36d42ca4b7), however the Monero sender is always unknown. Both Khan and Maria claim that they sent the payment, so you ask each to provide the transaction key.

Khan: `OutProofV1N4Y5pUJEnRACJyB5C3zK1zTqAihdnN8MfVZhEWfD13Z2N7Npt1uxa1EY7N7jnvuJF76tXUwKrakvZSxTj4Zux5SpavFb4X1jRcLAJ2b5hqviQPiS58j2qH53QL44CJEgHtY5`

Maria: `OutProofV1To53Qu2gegZbUevosKCTwrEdqiECgFyUygutXMEdhrHg1EtXMrFNaszWYFjdU4aXFZ2iPF8G8jzoDJzCoW5dsWvb4mVN65abAya3U47cGXs7WABrTzG5aPfV4YBANhwPgwD2`

When you check both of their transaction keys, Maria’s confirms payment to your address and Khan’s key returns “bad signature.” You can practice this yourself using the above address and transaction keys!

### Connecting to a remote node (optional)

You can reduce sync time and disk usage by connecting to a “remote node” instead of storing the entire blockchain on your device. Most mobile wallets are automatically configured to connect to a remote node. If you need to manually direct your software to a remote node, you can use the community resources at node.moneroworld.com port 18089.

Nodes are computers that have downloaded the entire blockchain, and assist other users by syncing their wallets and relaying their transactions. Running your own (local) node is best for privacy, and you can choose to share your node publically if you wish to help secure the network. Remote nodes are convenient, and allow a user to quickly begin using Monero without downloading the entire blockchain.

Running a node is not the same as “mining” Monero. Mining is a different resource-intensive process, not discussed until Chapter IV. Running a local node is a network/CPU-light process after the blockchain has synced once.
