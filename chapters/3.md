# How Monero works

The first two chapters covered everything you need to know about WHY to use Monero (Chapter 1 ) and HOW to use Monero (Chapter 2). By now, you have learned everything necessary to begin using Monero yourself!

The rest of this book contains extra details, for those wishing to dive deeper into how Monero works “behind the scenes.” Chapters 3 and 4 describe underlying technologies such as Monero’s privacy features, the blockchain, and the mining process - focusing on the understanding concepts, without digressing into the advanced mathematics​. Chapters 5 through {?} contain those nitty-gritty details for developers and cryptography geeks.

## Transaction and the Ledger

To set the stage for understanding Monero privacy technologies, we will consider how Monero are sent and received on the ledger. For this chapter, we will focus on blockchain functionality - an inherently tamper-proof shared database that keeps a list of Monero transactions. The details about blockchain security (mining, hashes, etc) are another topic, reserved for Chapter 4.

When you set up your wallet, it uses your secret “seed” to mathematically calculate sets of “public keys” and their corresponding “private keys” (technical details in chapter X). This process is carried out on your device, and can be executed offline; nothing is broadcast or recorded by the network during wallet generation.

You share your address (created from your public keys) to receive funds, which you can then access with your corresponding private keys. Until somebody sends you Monero, there will not be any entries on the blockchain that your private keys can unlock.

When somebody (a customer, an exchange, or a friend) sends you Monero, they will transmit a transaction that transfers some of their Menoroj to a new address that you can unlock with your private keys. In technical lingo, the “output” of their transaction is stored on the blockchain, for you to spend with your private keys at your leisure.

This jargon can be a bit confusing, since the cryptocurrency use of the word “output” is different from the typical meaning. All of the Moneroj that you “own” are simply outputs on the blockchain that your private keys unlock. 

Each time you receive Monero, you gain another output; each time you spend Monero, you use up one of your outputs and generate a new one for somebody else.

When your wallet is “scanning” or “syncing” this usually means that it is checking all of the outputs on the blockchain to test whether your private keys unlock any for you to spend. Your wallet “balance” is the total sum of these outputs that you can unlock. When you spend your Monero, you use up some of your outputs as “inputs” to a transaction that you broadcast to the network. Conceptually, the blockchain is simply a record of these transactions, each consuming the sender’s outputs as inputs, to generate a new output for the recipient.

The process described above is slightly simplified, to convey the crucial parts (private/public keys, transactions, inputs/outputs). The following sections delve into more details about how Monero’s privacy technologies.

## Privacy Technology Overview

The general principles and terminology introduced above are shared by most cryptocurrencies. Monero provides enhanced functionality and privacy through several unique cryptographic technologies that shield the users and their activity from public visibility. Figure X shows which features protect which transaction details:

* RingCT conceals the transaction amount
* Ring signatures obfuscate the sender
* One-time addresses ensure that the recipient address is not recorded on the blockchain
* Kovri breaks the link between your transactions and physical location by obfuscating the broadcast origin and concealing network signs of Monero activity

## Ring Confidential Transaction


RingCT is a cryptographic technology that conceals the amount of Monero being sent in any transaction. With most cryptocurrencies, transaction amounts are sent in cleartext, visible to any observer. RingCT keeps this sensitive information private by allowing the sender to prove that they have enough Monero for a transaction, without revealing the value of that amount! This is possible thanks to cryptographic “commitments” and “range proofs.”


When you send Monero, you “commit” the amount in a private way, revealing just enough information for the network to confirm the validity of the transaction, while not publicly disclosing the amount itself. Although the commitments look like encrypted output amounts, the miners are able to confirm that the transaction is not trying to fraudulently create or over-spend Monero. “Range proofs” are another important mechanism in RingCT, that ensure the committed amount is greater than zero, and less than a certain number. This is important, to prevent senders from committing negative or impossibly-high amounts of Monero. This secures the supply of Monero against fraudulent manipulation.

Prior to RingCT, Monero transactions were broken up into specific denominations (for example, 12.5 XMR would be sent as 10 XMR +2 XMR + 0.5 XMR) and the transaction amounts were visible to outside observers. RingCT was activated in January 2017, and rapid widespread adoption immediately followed. Within 1 month of its activation, approximately 98% of new transactions were using the RingCT protocol! Following Monero’s policy of enforced privacy-by-default, after September 2017, RingCT became mandatory for all Monero transactions. To spend any old pre-RingCT outputs, they must first be converted to RingCT outputs with masked amounts.

## Stealth (one-time) addresses

Stealth addresses are a Monero feature that protects the privacy of transaction recipients. Suppose you wish to give a few books about coping with a sensitive illness to your friend André, however you’re about to leave town for a trip and André won’t be around until next week. Perhaps you could ask your friendly neighbor to temporarily hold onto the books and pass them forward to the recipient.

Since André is a private person with a sensitive condition, you don’t want to simply tell your neighbor his name. How could you arrange the exchange while preserving André’s privacy? You could simply make up a one-time random code and tell your neighbor to give the books to whomever presents that code (e.g. give these books to the person who knows the phrase “PolarComboTango357”). Your neighbor will be able to keep track of the books and give them to André, without learning anything about their recipient.

Similar to the way you might use that random non-informative code to keep your neighbor from learning about your book recipients, Monero uses a system of one-time codes to prevent the the network from learning about Monero recipients! Instead of explicitly recording the recipient’s address in the blockchain (analogously, “give the books to André”), funds are always sent to a one-time “stealth address” (analogously, “give these books to the person who knows the phrase “PolarComboTango357”). The cryptographic techniques that secure stealth addresses solely for the recipient are discussed in chapter X, however the salient points are detailed below.

How is are these one-time addresses generated? Your regular Monero wallet address is a 95-character string, which incorporates two public keys (the “public view” and “public spend” keys) mathematically derived from your seed. When somebody sends you funds, they will use the public keys in your address along with some random data to generate a unique one-time public key. These one-time public keys that are recorded on the blockchain with receipt of funds are called “stealth addresses” because it is impossible for the network or an outside observer to connect these random codes back to the originating wallets. Improving privacy by not recording wallet addresses on the blockchain is a clear consequence of stealth addresses. An even bigger implication is that use of these unique one-time keys prevents multiple payments to the same address from being linked together!

Suppose you create some public art or workspace and post an address for cryptocurrency donations. If you use a coin with a transparent blockchain (e.g. bitcoin), then every incoming transaction will record that address in a searchable linkable form. Anybody can use a blockchain explorer to see how many donations you received, their amount, and whether or not you’ve moved the funds. Every incoming bitcoin transaction is indexed on the ledger by the address that you shared publicly.

If you post a Monero address instead, your donations are not exposed to public scrutiny. Each donor will generate a unique one-time stealth address, and record that to the ledger. The address that you posted will never appear on the blockchain, and the stealth addresses do not provide any information about the recipient. Since each donor mixes in their own random information to create the stealth address for their transaction, one donor would not recognize the stealth address generated by another.

All Monero transactions use stealth addresses, to enforce privacy for the entire network; your wallet automatically carries out the conversion from public addresses into unique one-time keys.

## Ring Signatures

Ring signatures are a Monero feature designed to protect a transaction’s sender by not revealing the true source of the Moneroj being spent. Before jumping into ring signatures (a Monero feature), we’ll introduce the concept of digital signatures in general.

“Digital signatures” are a cryptographic method for proving the source of a message and verifying that its contents have not been tampered with. Varying implementations of digital signatures are a key component of all cryptocurrencies. To spend one of your outputs, you compose a message to the network describing the transaction, “sign” it with your corresponding private key, then broadcast the result to the network. Before executing the transaction, the network checks the validity of the signature to verify that the message has not been altered and/or forged by a third party without the correct private key.

With transparent cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin, etc) the messages describing each transaction explicitly declare which outputs are being spent. This is useful for easy bookkeeping, since the network simply keeps track of unspent transaction outputs (UXTOs) that are valid inputs for new transactions. If somebody tries to spend the same bitcoin output twice (called “double-spending”) the fraudulent second transaction would be rejected, since the network knows that the owner already spent that output when they signed the first transaction. Unfortunately, this straightforward proof of ownership is highly detrimental to privacy, by definitively indicating the source of funds, and when a given output is spent.

Monero uses a different scheme known as “ring signatures.” This group-signing method allows one member to digitally sign the message on behalf of the group, while mixing in the public keys of the other members so that it is unclear who actively signed the message. It is possible cryptographically verify that one of the “ring members” signed the message, but impossible to determine which of the members actively created the signature.

Ring signatures are used in Monero to blend the keys from multiple outputs on the blockchain, to conceal which output is actually being spent. Suppose Maria wants to spend one of her Monero outputs, shown in red below. Her wallet will semi-randomly select several other past outputs on the blockchain (not belonging to Maria) and mix their public keys into the ring signature as “decoys.” The network is able to verify that one of the outputs is being spent, but not which output.

Ring signatures protect the sender in all transactions, since the recipient and Monero network are unable to ascertain which output in the ring is the true source of the funds. A significant consequence of ring signatures is that an outside observer is unable to definitively prove that an output has been spent! The fact that an output appears in a ring signature is entirely inconclusive, since it is impossible to distinguish whether it was truly being spent, or simply passively employed as a decoy ring member.

If it is impossible to tell whether a particular output has been spent, what is to stop somebody from trying to spend the same output twice? With one-output-one-signature transparent blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin) this is a trivial task: if some output has been used in a digital signature once, it is considered spent and cannot be used again. However, Monero outputs can show up in ring signatures before and after they have been spent, so double-spending must be prevented through other means.

This is accomplished through “key images” that are generated and recorded with each signature, uniquely derived from the actual output being spent. The network cannot ascertain which output created the key image, but it can check whether or not the key image has been used before! If an unsavory user were to try and spend the same output twice, it would generate the same key image both times, and the network would reject the fraudulent second transaction. Consequently, the network can prevent double-spend attacks, despite not knowing which outputs are spent!

The Monero network did not originally mandate ring signatures, which unfortunately allowed privacy-damaging “zero-mixin” transactions. Starting in 2016, the network began requiring two ring members for each signature, enforcing privacy-by-default for the sender. This was raised to a minimum “ringsize” of four possible signers in 2017, and set to a minimum of seven possible signers in 2018.

## Kovri

Kovri is a Monero feature that protects a transaction’s sender by concealing their physical location. Any device connected to the internet is assigned an IP address as an identifier to help route traffic to the correct user. However, this IP address can easily be connected to a user’s physical location and identity.

The cryptographic measures described in the previous section to protect the sender are effectively circumvented if an adversary uses the IP address that broadcast a transaction to identify its source. It is worth considering the unfortunate scenarios that can arise when Monero network activity is connected to physical location and identity.

The Monero network includes thousands of “nodes” scattered throughout the world. Any volunteer can turn their computer into a node and join the Monero network in receiving and relaying transactions. Nodes and adversaries with significant resources may be able to use a transaction’s originating IP address to identify the physical location of the sender. An unfair node might choose to not relay transactions from certain individuals or groups. Even worse, the geographic information revealed by IP addresses might lead adversaries pay a malicious visit to cryptocurrency users’ doorsteps.

The connection between IP addresses and Monero activity is not only a threat for the users broadcasting transactions. The network traffic through nodes is currently visible to internet service providers and other surveilling parties, which could put node owners at risk if their government or ISP does not endorse cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency miners can also experience unfair treatment if their IP addresses are connected to their network activity. Unfair parties might seek attack certain miners by censoring their blocks, perhaps due to some ideological disagreement, or to limit non-government or non-corporate mining.

Clearly, all parties in the Monero ecosystem benefit from the decoupling of their network activity from their IP addresses (and thus their physical location/identity). This type of anonymity is provided by Kovri, which is a routing technology designed to obscure transmissions’ sources. It is based on the decentralized Invisible Internet Project (I2P) specifications, which uses encryption and sophisticated routing techniques to create private network distributed across the internet. Messages broadcast on the I2P-based network cannot be connected to their originating IP addresses, which protects the privacy of end users and eliminates the ability to censor cryptocurrency activity based on physical information about its network participants.

The Monero community is developing this lightweight security-focused software with a general open-source implementation and common API that can be used for other application. Since I2P is a peer-to-peer technology, all cryptocurrencies and services using the Kovri network benefit from increased adoption! Kovri will soon be included with Monero releases, and enforced for all transactions as part of Monero’s privacy-by-default policy.

## Privacy technology summary

Monero uses several unique privacy technologies to protect various elements of the network and both parties in all transactions. RingCT conceals the amount sent in each transaction. Ring signatures protect the sender by concealing the source of the funds, while One-time addresses ensure that the recipient’s address is not recorded on the blockchain. Kovri is a transaction-routing technology that breaks the link between your Monero activity, and your physical location/identity.

Together, these features ensure that Monero users remain anonymous, and that funds are not trackable. By cryptographically eliminating all the links used in analyzing transactions on the blockchain, Monero achieves “fungibility,” which is a necessary characteristic of practical currencies. Now that you have read this chapter, you can understand how Monero protects the individuals described in theuse cases described earlier.
